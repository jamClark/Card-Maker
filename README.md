# Card-Maker
A simple, proprietary tool that was developed to aid in rapid prototyping of an LCG (Living Card Game).

This tool was developed early in a living Card Game project as a means of organizing data, rapdily printing cards to 8.5x11 paper for prototyping, and exporting to Adobe Illustrator datasets that could be used to automate the process of creating the final card designs that would be sent to the printer for final prints.

It was developed under a very short time constraint and required that I learn the basics of and utilize WPF in a matter of days. As a result, many aspects are extremely hard-coded for the project but I feel it demonstrates some interesting concepts and provides some handy utility in the form of XML exporting tools that can be used to import datasets into Adobe Illustrator.

A binary build of the project has been supplied along with the source code.
